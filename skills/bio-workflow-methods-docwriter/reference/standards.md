# Standards & guidelines to align with (cheat sheet)

## Provenance / workflow run packaging
- RO-Crate (workflow/run packaging with JSON-LD metadata)
- W3C PROV (provenance data model: entities, activities, agents)
- CWLProv (CWL/Nextflow provenance captured as Research Object)
- BioCompute Objects (IEEE 2791-2020) for HTS workflow communication

## Publication / reporting expectations (computational)
- Include software/code availability, data availability, dataset accessions
- Report software versions and key parameters (or pin via containers)

## Documentation structure & style
- Diátaxis (Tutorial / How-to / Reference / Explanation)
- Docs-as-code: version docs with the pipeline, update alongside changes
