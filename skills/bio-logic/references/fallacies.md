# Logical Fallacies Reference

## Causation Fallacies

| Fallacy | Pattern | Example |
|---------|---------|---------|
| Post hoc | B followed A → A caused B | "Took supplement, cold went away, supplement cured cold" |
| Correlation=causation | A correlates with B → A causes B | "Chocolate consumption correlates with Nobel prizes" |
| Reverse causation | A→B confused with B→A | "Inflammation causes depression" (or vice versa?) |
| Single cause | Complex outcome attributed to one factor | "Crime is caused by poverty" |

## Generalization Fallacies

| Fallacy | Pattern | Example |
|---------|---------|---------|
| Hasty generalization | Small sample → universal claim | "5 patients improved, drug works" |
| Anecdotal | Personal story as proof | "My grandmother smoked and lived to 100" |
| Cherry-picking | Only supporting evidence shown | Citing only positive studies |
| Ecological | Group patterns → individual | "High-income area → this person is wealthy" |

## Authority Fallacies

| Fallacy | Pattern | Example |
|---------|---------|---------|
| Appeal to authority | Expert said it → must be true | "Dr. X says so" (without evidence) |
| Appeal to nature | Natural → good/safe | "Herbal, so no side effects" |
| Appeal to antiquity | Old → true/good | "Used for centuries, must work" |
| Genetic | Source determines validity | "From pharma, so biased" (regardless of evidence) |

## Statistical Fallacies

| Fallacy | Pattern | Example |
|---------|---------|---------|
| Base rate neglect | Ignoring prior probability | 99% accurate test + rare disease ≠ 99% certainty |
| Texas sharpshooter | Find pattern → claim prediction | Data mining until finding significant correlation |
| Multiple comparisons | Many tests → report hits | "Jellybean color X causes acne" (after testing 20 colors) |
| Prosecutor's fallacy | P(E|H) confused with P(H|E) | "1 in million match" ≠ "1 in million innocent" |

## Structural Fallacies

| Fallacy | Pattern | Example |
|---------|---------|---------|
| False dichotomy | Only A or B, ignoring C | "Either genetic or environmental" (usually both) |
| Moving goalposts | Changing standards after met | "Show me a study" → "That's just one study" → ... |
| Straw man | Misrepresent argument to attack | "Evolution says we came from monkeys" |
| Begging the question | Conclusion in premises | "Medicine works because it has healing properties" |

## Science-Specific Fallacies

| Fallacy | Pattern | Example |
|---------|---------|---------|
| Galileo gambit | Outsiders were right before → I'm right | "They laughed at Galileo..." |
| Argument from ignorance | Not disproven → true | "No proof homeopathy doesn't work" |
| Nirvana fallacy | Imperfect → worthless | "Vaccines aren't 100% effective, so useless" |
| Unfalsifiability | No possible disproof | "Works only if you believe" |

## Detection Strategy

1. **Identify the claim** - What exactly is being argued?
2. **Identify the evidence** - What supports it?
3. **Check the logic** - Does evidence actually support claim?
4. **Consider alternatives** - What else could explain this?
5. **Test consistency** - Would this reasoning work in other cases?

## Response Template

When identifying a fallacy:

```
**Fallacy**: [Name]
**Quote**: "[Problematic statement]"
**Issue**: [Why the reasoning is flawed]
**What would be needed**: [Evidence that would support the claim]
```

**Note**: Fallacious reasoning doesn't prove the conclusion false—only that this argument doesn't support it.
