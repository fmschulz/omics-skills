# Questionnaire Notes
- Extended Data and methods mention IQ-TREE for tree inference.

# Protocol Summary
## Workflow
The study builds maximum-likelihood phylogenetic trees with IQ-TREE to infer evolutionary history of widespread dandelion subspecies.

## QC and Outputs
Bootstrap support and model selection are used for QC, producing phylogenies and evolutionary conclusions.
