# Questionnaire Notes
- Metadata from the Digital Discovery 2025 article page.

# Protocol Summary
## Workflow
Boltz-1 is used to predict protein complex structures for PROTAC-mediated E3-ligase recruitment analyses.

## QC and Outputs
Predictions are benchmarked against known complex structures, producing inferred interaction models.

# Sources
