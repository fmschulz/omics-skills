# Notebook AI Agents Skill (Marimo First)

This folder is an **Agent Skill** that teaches an AI agent to:
- build/refactor **Marimo** notebooks with a clean narrative structure,
- use per-directory Pixi environments via `pixi.toml`,
- load data reliably (DuckDB + TSV/Parquet) using correct paths,
- generate polished plots with minimal whitespace,
- *never* claim completion until the notebook passes a full run-all execution.

**Jupyter support is minimal** and intended for existing `.ipynb` files.
