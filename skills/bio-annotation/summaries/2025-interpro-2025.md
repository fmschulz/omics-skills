# Questionnaire Notes
- Extracted from the 2025 InterPro update paper.
- Focused on InterProScan usage for protein annotation.

# Protocol Summary
## Workflow
The resource update describes how InterPro integrates member database signatures for protein classification and annotation. InterProScan is the tool used to scan query proteins against these signatures to assign functions, domains, and families.

## QC and Outputs
Curation and integration steps are emphasized; outputs include updated InterPro entries and annotations for downstream functional inference.
