# Questionnaire Notes
- Extracted from the NAR 2023 eggNOG 6.0 update paper.
- Focused on functional annotation and orthology resources used by eggNOG-mapper.

# Protocol Summary
## Workflow
The paper describes the update of eggNOG to version 6.0, expanding orthology coverage and functional annotation consistency. These updates support downstream homology-based annotation (eggNOG-mapper) for functional inference across large genome collections.

## QC and Outputs
Curation and database validation steps are described at a high level; outputs include updated orthology groups and functional annotations distributed as eggNOG resources.
